# Kadisoka Identity Server

Kadisoka IAM is a service module which provides identity and access
management subsystem either as separate service (following microservice
paradigm) or as a library for monolithic service applications.

## Features

* Flexible utilizations: as microservice or as a package to be imported into
  your Go applications. Transitioning between utilization types is possible.
* OAuth 2.0 conforming authorization server
* Web UI which provides good user experience. We want that out of the box,
  this project provides not only functional, but also good experience for
  the users.
* Online and always up-to-date REST API documentation
* Non-desctructive database design
* Designed to be resilient
* Password-based user authentication. Supported algorithm: argon2
* SMS delivery service integrations (for delivering the OTPs): Vonage (Nexmo),
  Telesign, Twilio
* Email delivery service integrations (for delivering the OTPs): Amazon SES
* Database system support: PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

This project was designed to use
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as the primary way to
run locally. Be sure to have Docker and docker-compose installed. Go binary
distribution is not needed to be installed on the host.

The root `docker-compose.yaml` file was designed to run the independent server
application which source and its required resources are located in folder
`iam-server`. Once started, user and other applications could connect to it.

To start the server:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

You might see some errors in the logs. These errors are not unexpected as
the we designed the service to be resilient. The service will exit if any of
the required services are not ready yet.

Wait until you see "Services are ready" in the logs and then you can access
the user web UI at `http://localhost:11111/` from the host. The REST API
documentation could be accessed at `http://localhost:11121/rest/apidocs/`.

### Starting the examples

Each of these examples is independent, and none of them depend on
`iam-server` mentioned above, in fact, you must stop it or any of the examples
before you can start another because there might be port conflicts.

#### Monolithic application example

The monolithic application example is located in `examples/monolith`. To start
it, set working directory to project's root (where this README.md file is
located) and run the command:

```shell
docker-compose -f examples/monolith/docker-compose.yaml up --build
```

Wait until it started and then open up `http://localhost:8080/` in a web
browser.

#### Microservices example

TBD

## Use cases

### Identity server mock

As your projects are integrated to other identity management service, you
would need to test the integrations. This project could be used as a mock of
the identity server your projects depended on.

### Monolithic service applications

If you are writing web service in Go and it is relatively small in scale,
like a simple online shop, a CMS, or a blog, you could import this module
into your application to provide user account management.

Monolithic architecture is preferable if your service is relatively small as
it's easier to maintain. If your application is getting popular, you can
transition to microservice architecture with minimum effort.

### Microservices set up
